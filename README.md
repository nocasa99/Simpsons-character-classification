# Simpsons character detection using custom CNN
This repository consists of the custom CNN model I used to detect and classify the Simpson characters. 

##dataset
I used a popular dataset from kaggle namely - The Simpsons Characters Data by Alexiattia. 
The data went through preprocessing before being fetched to the model. 


##CNN model
I used only 25 epochs which led to an accuracy of 0.4763
My custom CNN model had 3 conv2D layers, 3 MaxPooling2D layers, 3 Batch normalization, 2 dense and 4 dropout layers.

##test data
The test data had to undergo the same preprocess setup before predictions.
